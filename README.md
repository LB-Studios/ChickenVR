# Chicken VR

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LBStudios/ChickenVR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LBStudios/ChickenVR)

Chicken VR is a first person virtual reality chicken experience. Participants use a variety of chicken behaviors such as pecking, flapping, and laying eggs inside a virtual
space. We began work on Chicken VR during our eighth grade year at Black Pine Circle School (Berkeley, CA). This project was presented at 2017 East Bay Mini Maker Faire and
2018 Bay Area Maker Faire. We shared it because we believe everyone deserves a chance to experience life as a chicken. You can read more about our Maker Faire experience

**Where to find the game**

[Chicken VR is on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/910260/Chicken_VR/). The source code is on GitHub for us and anyone curious about how we made the game. It builds with Unity 2017.4.7f1 and should work with newer versions.
