# Chicken VR

Chicken VR is a first person virtual reality chicken experience. Participants use a variety of chicken behaviors such as pecking, flapping, and laying eggs inside a virtual
space. We began work on Chicken VR during our eighth grade year at Black Pine Circle School (Berkeley, CA). This project was presented at 2017 East Bay Mini Maker Faire and
2018 Bay Area Maker Faire. We shared it because we believe everyone deserves a chance to experience life as a chicken. You can read more about our Maker Faire experience

**Where to find the game**

We are currently working on publishing the game on Steam for anyone to play, but for now you can run it on Unity yourself. We also plan to make a desktop version that won't
require an HTC Vive. This will be included in a future update.

**About us**

We, Elan Bustos and Reuben Lewis, are high school students in the San Francisco Bay Area (East Bay). We make stuff.
